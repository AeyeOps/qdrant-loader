# Dependency fixes for Windows compatibility
# Issue: tree-sitter-languages>=1.10.0 has no wheels for certain Python versions
# Fix: Use tree-sitter-languages==1.10.0 (exact version) or make it optional

[qdrant-loader pyproject.toml fixes]
Original dependency line 61:
    "tree-sitter-languages>=1.10.0",

Fix options:
1. Use exact version:
    "tree-sitter-languages==1.10.0",

2. Make it optional with fallback:
    "tree-sitter>=0.20.0,<0.21",
    # Remove tree-sitter-languages entirely and implement fallback

3. Add Windows-specific constraints:
    "tree-sitter-languages>=1.10.0; platform_system!='Windows'",
    "tree-sitter>=0.20.0,<0.21; platform_system=='Windows'",

The recommended fix is option 3 - platform-specific dependencies that avoid
the problematic tree-sitter-languages on Windows while keeping full
functionality on other platforms.
