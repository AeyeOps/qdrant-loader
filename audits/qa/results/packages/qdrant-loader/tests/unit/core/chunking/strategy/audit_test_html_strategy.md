- Excellent use of docstrings to explain test purpose
- Consistent naming pattern: test_[method]_[scenario]
- Clear arrange/act/assert structure in all tests
- Good class-level organization with descriptive class names
```

---

## 🧪 **Test Case Types Present**

* [x] **Positive Tests** - Normal HTML parsing, successful chunking, proper section identification
* [x] **Negative Tests** - Malformed HTML handling, exception scenarios
* [x] **Boundary/Edge Case Tests** - Large files, section limits, performance constraints
* [x] **Regression Tests** - Section merging, title extraction, breadcrumb building
* [x] **Security/Permission Tests** - Not applicable for this component
* [x] **Smoke/Sanity Tests** - Basic initialization and chunking functionality

## ✅ Suggested Action Items

```markdown
- Consider parameterizing the section type identification tests to reduce code duplication
- Add test for edge case where HTML has deeply nested structures (>10 levels)
- Consider adding test for HTML with mixed character encodings
- Add test for edge case where HTML contains only script/style tags
- Consider testing behavior with HTML5 semantic elements (time, mark, etc.)
- Add test for HTML with very long attribute values
```

## 📈 **Test Quality Score: OUTSTANDING (9.4/10)**

**Strengths:**
* Outstanding test organization with clear separation of concerns
* Comprehensive coverage of HTML-specific features
* Excellent integration test scenarios
* Proper performance testing with limits
* Good coverage of edge cases and error handling
* Excellent fixture design for complex HTML scenarios

**Areas for Improvement:**
* Minor opportunities for parameterization
* Could add more character encoding tests
* Performance testing could include memory usage

**Overall Assessment:** This is an outstanding test suite that provides comprehensive coverage of the HTMLChunkingStrategy class. The test organization is exemplary with clear separation between unit tests and integration tests. The integration scenarios are particularly valuable for ensuring the strategy works correctly with real-world HTML content including multimedia, forms, and complex nested structures. The performance testing and limit enforcement are noteworthy features that ensure the strategy remains robust under stress.
