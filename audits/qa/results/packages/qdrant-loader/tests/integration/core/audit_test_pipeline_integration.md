## 🧱 **Test Structure & Design Assessment**

* [x] **Clarity & Intent**: Test cases clearly describe multi-project pipeline scenarios
* [x] **Modularity**: Tests are well-organized with comprehensive fixtures
* [x] **Setup/Teardown**: Excellent fixture design for complex multi-project setup

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Excellent fixture design for complex multi-project configuration
- Clear separation of different integration scenarios
- Good use of async/await patterns for testing async pipeline
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
```

---

## 🔁 **Redundancy and Duplication Check**

* [x] **Are similar tests repeated across different files?** No significant overlap with unit tests
* [x] **Do tests provide new coverage or just edge-case noise?** Provides critical integration coverage
* [x] **Can multiple test cases be merged with parameterization?** Current structure is appropriate for complex scenarios

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Mock session setup is repeated but serves different test scenarios
- Each test focuses on a specific aspect of multi-project integration
- No redundant tests identified - each provides unique integration value
- Complex fixture setup is justified by the integration complexity
```
