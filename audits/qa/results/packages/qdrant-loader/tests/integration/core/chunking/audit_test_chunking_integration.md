* [x] **CI/CD Integration Validates These Tests Reliably?** Deterministic behavior with proper mocking

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Tests execute quickly due to focused scope
- Well-isolated tests that don't interfere with each other
- Deterministic behavior ensures reliable CI/CD execution
- Good coverage of different document scenarios
```

---

## 📋 **Naming, Documentation & Maintainability**

* [x] **Descriptive Test Names?** Clear and descriptive test method names
* [x] **Comments for Complex Logic?** Good docstrings explaining test purpose
* [x] **Clear Test Scenarios (Arrange/Act/Assert)?** Clear AAA pattern throughout
* [x] **Consistent Style and Conventions?** Consistent with project standards

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Test names clearly describe the chunking integration scenario
- Good docstrings explaining test purpose and expected behavior
- Consistent use of pytest conventions and fixtures
- Clear separation of test setup and execution
```

---

## 🧪 **Test Case Types Present**

* [x] **Positive Tests** - Normal chunking integration scenarios
* [x] **Negative Tests** - Limited negative testing
* [x] **Boundary/Edge Case Tests** - Different conversion methods and document types
* [x] **Regression Tests** - Validates chunking integration functionality
* [ ] **Security/Permission Tests** - No security testing
* [x] **Smoke/Sanity Tests** - Basic chunking integration validation

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Good coverage of different conversion scenarios and document types
- Tests strategy selection and metadata preservation
- Limited negative testing - could benefit from error scenarios
- No security testing for malicious document handling
```
