📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Document creation patterns are repeated but test different state scenarios
- Each test class focuses on a specific aspect of state management integration
- No redundant tests identified - each provides unique integration value
- Good separation of concerns between different test classes
```

## 🧪 **Test Case Types Present**

* [x] **Positive Tests** - Normal state management scenarios
* [x] **Negative Tests** - Conversion failure scenarios
* [x] **Boundary/Edge Case Tests** - Multiple attachments, complex workflows
* [x] **Regression Tests** - Validates state management functionality
* [ ] **Security/Permission Tests** - Limited security testing
* [x] **Smoke/Sanity Tests** - Basic state management validation

📝 Observations:

```markdown
- Comprehensive coverage of state management scenarios
- Good testing of both success and failure cases
- Tests complex relationships (parent-child attachments)
- Could benefit from security tests for state access control
```

---

## 🏁 **Summary Assessment**

* **Coverage Value**: **High** - Critical state management integration
* **Refactoring Required?** **Minor** - Could extract document creation utilities
