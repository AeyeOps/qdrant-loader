# üìÑ Code Audit Instructions

## üéØ **Objective**

The purpose of this audit is to **systematically evaluate the technical quality, structure, maintainability, and AI integrity** of every single Python file in the project. This audit should identify issues, document design patterns, spot anti-patterns, and ensure alignment with software engineering best practices.

## üß© **Scope**

The audit includes, but is not limited to:

* Core Python logic
* AI/ML model implementation
* Data processing pipelines
* Configuration and environment management
* Logging, error handling, and testing
* Documentation embedded in code (docstrings, type hints)
* Code structure and modularity
* Dependency management and security

## üîç Audit Process (File-by-File)

* **These instructions MUST BE FOLLOWED ABSOLUTELY**

For each markdown file listed in the [Technicla Audit List](./TechnicalAuditList.md) :

* Perform systematically every single of the following comprehensive checks
* Never rely on another document to check accuracy unless the document has already been checked
* Write down you observations in a file ( one for each audited file ) in the [Technical Audit Result](./results/) folder
* Once a document is check, indicate that with a checkbox in the [Technical Audit List](./TechnicalAuditList.md) before moving onto the next file to check.

Repeat the following audit process for **each file individually**.

### 1. üìå **File Overview**

* File Name: `filename.py`
* Location in Repository: `path/to/file`
* Brief Description of Purpose:

  * *E.g.*, "Handles preprocessing for NLP models."

### 2. üß± **Structural & Design Assessment**

* [ ] **Modular Design**: Is the file broken into well-structured classes/functions?
* [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Are responsibilities clearly divided?
* [ ] **Code Reusability**: Are utility methods reused properly across the project?
* [ ] **Complexity**: Any signs of overengineering or under-engineering?

### 3. üß† **AI/ML-Specific Concerns** (If applicable)

* [ ] **Model Training Code Present?**

  * Training loop structured well?
  * Model serialization in place?
* [ ] **Inference Code Present?**

  * Efficient use of models at inference time?
  * Use of batch prediction or streaming?
* [ ] **Data Handling**

  * Dataset loading: Secure, reproducible, memory-safe?
  * Feature engineering logic clear and testable?
* [ ] **Framework-Specific Issues**

  * TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. used correctly?
  * GPU/TPU considerations handled?
* [ ] **AI Ethics Checks**

### 5. üß∞ **Dependencies & Imports**

* [ ] **Unused Imports**: Any unnecessary modules?
* [ ] **Relative vs Absolute Imports**: Consistency?
* [ ] **Third-party Libraries**: Are they justified and properly version-pinned?
* [ ] **Security Checks**: Known CVEs or deprecated packages?

Add observations here:

```markdown
- Observation 1:
- Observation 2:
```

### 6. üß™ **Testing and Coverage**

* [ ] **Unit Tests Exist**: Are there matching test files/modules?
* [ ] **Test Coverage**: How much of this file is tested?
* [ ] **Mocking**: Are external dependencies mocked correctly?
* [ ] **Edge Cases**: Are they tested?
* [ ] **Integration/Functional Tests**: Present and meaningful?

### ‚úÖ Suggested Action Items

List all actionable recommendations here.

```markdown
- Refactor class `X` to break out preprocessing logic into separate modules.
- Replace hardcoded `'/tmp/model.pt'` with a config reference.
- Add test coverage for corner cases in `data_cleaner.py`.
```

### üîÅ Audit Checklist (Repeat for All Files)

For every `.py` file, copy the above structure and repeat the audit.
