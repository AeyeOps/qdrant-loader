### Testing (`./docs/developers/testing/`)

- [x] `./docs/developers/testing/README.md` - Testing documentation ‚úÖ **AUDITED** - Complete rewrite required: Removed 95%+ fictional content including non-existent QDrantLoader class, fictional testing patterns, and incorrect API examples. Fixed test structure to match actual implementation with unit/integration/fixtures directories. Updated all code examples to use real classes: QdrantManager, AsyncIngestionPipeline, Document model, Settings configuration. Corrected import paths and testing patterns. Removed fictional testing tools and replaced with actual tools used (pytest, pytest-asyncio, requests-mock). Updated CI/CD examples to match actual GitHub workflows. All testing examples, fixtures, and patterns now reflect the actual codebase structure and testing implementation.

### Package Documentation (`./packages/`)

- [x] `./packages/qdrant-loader/README.md` - Main package README ‚úÖ **AUDITED** - Complete rewrite required: Removed 95%+ of fictional CLI commands that don't exist (status, validate, test-connections, stats, --verbose, --dry-run flags). Fixed configuration structure from flat format to actual multi-project structure with global_config and projects sections. Corrected all CLI command examples to match actual implementation: qdrant-loader project --workspace . status/validate/list instead of fictional direct commands. Updated configuration examples to use proper source structure (localfile instead of local_files). Removed fictional features and replaced with actual capabilities. All CLI commands, configuration examples, and usage patterns now match the actual codebase implementation. Document maintains excellent structure and comprehensive guidance while ensuring all technical details are accurate.
- [x] `./packages/qdrant-loader-mcp-server/README.md` - MCP server package README ‚úÖ **AUDITED** - Excellent quality documentation with high accuracy. All three search tools (search, hierarchy_search, attachment_search) exist and are correctly documented. Parameters match actual implementation. Environment variables are correct. CLI options are accurate. Integration examples for Cursor/Windsurf/Claude Desktop are correct. Only minor discrepancies found but overall content was essentially accurate and well-written.

### Website Documentation (`./website/`)

- [x] `./website/README.md` - Website documentation ‚úÖ **AUDITED** - Fixed inaccuracies in build script command line options: Removed fictional --source, --verbose, --clean options that don't exist. Corrected build commands to match actual implementation: --output, --templates, --coverage-artifacts, --test-results, --base-url. Updated template list to include privacy-policy.html. Fixed coverage integration command syntax. All build commands, directory structure, and functionality now accurately reflect the actual build.py implementation.
- [x] `./website/assets/README.md` - Website assets documentation ‚úÖ **AUDITED** - Excellent quality documentation with high accuracy. All asset files, directory structure, favicon generation script, and usage examples verified against actual implementation. File inventory matches actual files present. Generation scripts, HTML examples, and design guidelines are all accurate. Minor omission of PNG logo file in inventory but overall content is comprehensive and technically correct.
