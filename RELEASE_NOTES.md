# Release Notes

## Version 0.4.15 - July 22, 2025

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Chunking Strategy Consistency

- **Fixed chunking strategy inconsistency**: Resolved major discrepancy where `DefaultChunkingStrategy` and `MarkdownChunkingStrategy` interpreted `chunk_size` parameter differently
  - **Problem**: Default strategy used token-based chunking (600 tokens ‚âà 2,400-3,000 chars) vs markdown strategy's character-based chunking (600 chars)
  - **Impact**: This caused 4-5x difference in chunk counts between strategies for the same configuration
  - **Solution**: Modified `DefaultChunkingStrategy` to always use character-based chunking for consistency
  - **Tokenizer role**: Tokenizer now only used for smart boundary detection (avoiding mid-word splits) while respecting character-based size limits
- **Enhanced boundary detection**: Improved word/token boundary detection while maintaining character-based sizing
- **Updated documentation**: Clarified that all chunking strategies now consistently use character-based `chunk_size` interpretation
- **Comprehensive testing**: Added integration tests to verify consistency between strategies and prevent regression

## Version 0.4.14 - July 13, 2025

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Excel File Chunking Fixes

- **Fixed regex error in table detection**: Resolved `bad character range |-\s at position 2` error that was preventing Excel files from being chunked properly
  - **Root cause**: Invalid regex pattern `r"^[|-\s:]+$"` in `_split_excel_sheet_content` method
  - **Solution**: Escaped dash character to create valid pattern: `r"^[|\-\s:]+$"`
  - **Impact**: Excel files no longer fall back to default chunking strategy
- **Fixed large table chunking logic**: Resolved issue where large Excel tables were treated as single massive chunks
  - **Problem**: 128K character files created only 2-5 chunks instead of ~200 chunks at 600-character limit
  - **Root cause**: Large logical units (tables) were not split when exceeding max_size
  - **Solution**: Added intelligent splitting logic that preserves table structure while respecting chunk size limits
  - **Result**: Large Excel files now properly chunk into appropriate sizes (e.g., 74K chars ‚Üí 127 chunks @ ~588 chars each)
- **Eliminated token limit warnings**: Fixed the `Content exceeds maximum token limit, truncating` warnings that occurred with large Excel chunks
  - **Before**: Chunks up to 128K characters (47K+ tokens) being truncated
  - **After**: All chunks properly sized to stay within token limits
- **Enhanced table structure preservation**: Table boundaries are now intelligently detected and preserved during chunking

#### Technical Improvements

- **Better logical unit management**: Enhanced `_split_excel_sheet_content` to handle large units by splitting at line boundaries
- **Preserved table formatting**: Chunking algorithm maintains table structure integrity while enforcing size limits
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and fallback behavior for edge cases
- **Performance optimization**: More efficient chunking for large Excel files without infinite loops

#### Testing & Validation

- **All existing tests pass**: 50 markdown strategy tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility
- **Verified chunking accuracy**: Large test files now produce expected chunk counts with proper size distribution
- **Regex pattern validation**: Confirmed table detection works correctly for all markdown table formats

## Version 0.4.13 - July 11, 2025

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Excel File Chunking Improvements

- **Enhanced Excel-to-markdown chunking**: Improved MarkdownChunkingStrategy to properly handle Excel files converted to markdown by MarkItDown
- **Sheet-aware sectioning**: Excel files now split on H2 headers (sheet names) instead of treating the entire file as one "Preamble" section
- **Table-aware chunking**: Added specialized `_split_excel_sheet_content` method that preserves table structure when splitting large sheets
- **Intelligent content detection**: Automatically detects converted Excel files based on `original_file_type` metadata and applies appropriate chunking rules
- **Backward compatibility**: Regular markdown files continue to use H1-only sectioning, maintaining existing behavior
- **Comprehensive testing**: Added 3 new test cases covering Excel chunking scenarios and ensuring regular markdown files are unaffected

#### Technical Improvements

- **Context-aware splitting**: Different header level thresholds based on file type (H1 for markdown, H1+H2 for Excel)
- **Enhanced metadata tracking**: Added `is_excel_sheet` metadata to identify Excel-derived chunks

#### Processing Pipeline

- **Fixed content truncation**: Eliminated "maximum chunks per section limit" warnings by making limits dynamic based on user configuration
- **Improved chunk estimation**: Added better user guidance for optimal chunk count configuration
