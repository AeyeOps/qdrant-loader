### üéâ Major Improvements

#### File Conversion & Processing Overhaul

**Fixed Critical File Conversion Issues**

- **Fixed file conversion initialization**: Resolved issue where file conversion was not working due to missing `set_file_conversion_config` calls in the pipeline ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- **Enhanced strategy selection**: Converted files (Excel, Word, PDF, etc.) now correctly use `MarkdownChunkingStrategy` instead of `DefaultChunkingStrategy` ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- **Improved NLP processing**: Converted files now have full NLP processing enabled instead of being skipped with `content_type_inappropriate` ([7de3526](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/7de3526))

**Enhanced File Processing Pipeline**

- Added proper file conversion configuration initialization in source processors ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- Implemented automatic strategy selection based on conversion status ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- Fixed metadata propagation for converted files ([7de3526](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/7de3526))

#### Chunking Strategy Improvements

**Resolved Infinite Loop Issues**

- **Fixed MarkdownChunkingStrategy infinite loops**: Resolved critical issue where documents with very long words would create infinite loops, hitting the 1000 chunk limit ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- **Added safety limits**: Implemented `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SECTION = 100` and `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_DOCUMENT = 500` limits ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added proper handling for words longer than `max_size` by truncating them with warnings ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))

**Improved Chunking Logic**

- Added safety checks to prevent infinite loops in `_split_large_section` method ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- Enhanced logging for debugging chunking issues ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))
- Added warnings when chunking limits are reached ([9d16b8d](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/9d16b8d))

#### Workspace Management

**Better Log Organization**

- **Fixed workspace logs location**: Logs are now stored in `workspace_path/logs/qdrant-loader.log` instead of cluttering the workspace root ([589ae4b](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/589ae4b))
- **Enhanced workspace structure**: Added automatic creation of logs directory ([589ae4b](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/589ae4b))
- **Updated documentation**: Reflected new log structure in workspace mode documentation ([589ae4b](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/589ae4b))

#### Resource Management & Stability

**Fixed Pipeline Hanging Issues**

- **Resolved ResourceManager cleanup**: Fixed issue where normal cleanup was setting shutdown events, causing workers to exit prematurely ([4844abf](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/4844abf))
- **Enhanced signal handling**: Distinguished between normal cleanup and signal-based shutdown ([4844abf](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/4844abf))
- **Improved graceful shutdown**: Workers now properly complete processing before shutdown ([4844abf](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/4844abf))

**Performance Optimizations**

- Increased `MAX_CHUNKS_TO_PROCESS` from 100 to 1000 chunks to accommodate larger documents ([1bfe550](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/commit/1bfe550))
